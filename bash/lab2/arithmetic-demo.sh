# Task 1: Remove the assignments of numbers to the first and second number variables. Use one or more read commands to get 3 numbers from the user.
# Task 2: Change the output to only show:
#    the sum of the 3 numbers with a label
#    the product of the 3 numbers with a label

echo "Thanks"
echo ""
read -p "Please enter the second number: " secondnum

cat <<EOF
$firstnum plus $secondnum is $sum
$firstnum divided by $secondnum is $dividend
  - More precisely, it is $fpdividend
EOF
